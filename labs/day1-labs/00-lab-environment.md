# Lab Environment

## Classroom Setting

These labs are designed for delivery in a classroom setting with the **Azure Global Blackbelt Team.** We typically provide an Azure subcription and a Linux VM (jumpbox) for attendees to complete the labs.

A couple labs require the linux jumpbox and most others are intended to be completed in the Azure Cloud Shell. 

## Self-guided

It is possible to use your own machine outside of the classroom. You will need the following in order to complete these labs: 

* Azure subscription
* Linux, Mac, or Windows with Bash
* Docker
* Azure CLI
* Visual Studio Code
* Helm
* Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)
* mongoDB (only lab #1 requires this)
* Github account and git tools
